## Objectives for the seminar

This seminar has been designed to provide materials for a 3-session Python seminar. It consists of several Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks with self-contained solutions, designed for every participant **to proceed at their own pace**.

The participant is expected to have a basic command of programming languages, if possible with Python, and a decent scientific background with a good understanding of common algorithmic and programming design challenges.

After the seminar, the participant should be able to:

- attend applied mathematics, engineering or artificial intelligence classes which provide examples and exercices using Jupyter notebooks;
- write and run a Python script **outside the Jupyter environment**;
- **install and manage** a Python or Anaconda environment on their home computer.

Participants are considered consenting adults. Enough material is provided to get proficient quickly and ask questions when needed. Obviously, the more assiduous you are, the better, and learning practices best suiting you are in your hands. In particular, it is perfectly acceptable:

- to peak into the solutions when you are stuck, or to read them thoroughly;
- to skip sections when it becomes overwhelming, or boring;
- to extend problems, find new issues and discuss them with your teacher assistant;
- to find issues in the provided materials;
- to fix them, see [how to create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request).
